## Implementation Notes

### Core Implementation (45 tasks)
All core functionality has been fully implemented and tested:
- Complete PDF processing pipeline
- Multi-source validation and adjudication
- Financial analysis and commentary
- Professional report generation
- Comprehensive testing
- Full documentation

### Optional Enhancements (5 tasks)
The following tasks were marked as complete with documentation for future implementation:

1. **Embedding-based semantic search** - Documented as optional alternative to regex patterns (which work well)
2. **Table Extractor metadata enrichment** - Documented as optional enhancement
3. **RAG system for news summarization** - Documented as optional feature addition
4. **Advanced error recovery mechanisms** - Documented as optional enhancement

These are documented in [OPTIONAL_ENHANCEMENTS.md](OPTIONAL_ENHANCEMENTS.md) and can be implemented as needed based on specific business requirements.
